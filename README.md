Known Issues and Bugs and reasons for that

Following issues and bugs are discovered while testing

âž¡ When loading the songs to playlist it shows the full file path instead of file name

   o This is because I used QStreingList to store the files paths, but to get the file name it can be easily done by using QString and QFileInfo.MetaData(); but it doesnâ€™t support for QStreingList. i have tried many methods to do that but it wonâ€™t work. I have commented those methods I tried in on_actionOpen_triggered().

âž¡ When playing the song I tried to display the Album art of the song in the player if available, or otherwise play an equalizer gif to give more attractiveness to player, for some reason itâ€™s not working and I couldnâ€™t resolve that

âž¡ When you clicked shuffle icon it shuffle but canâ€™t restore the playlist

   o Itâ€™s because of thereâ€™s no such method implemented yet in QMediaPlayer.Shuffle().

âž¡ When playing the song the title of the song must showing in QLable under the equalizer image. But itâ€™s not showing. But if you stop the song while playing and play again it works. There must be some logical error I couldnâ€™t figure out yet.
